This repository  contains a tutorial and learning material for [IntelMQ](https://github.com/certtools/intelmq/).
It is accompanied by a [VirtualBox VM image](https://intelmq.org/tutorial/workshop-vm-20200131.ova), which allows you to follow every step. Please download and get the VM image running in VirtualBox (Click here for a [64 bit version](https://intelmq.org/tutorial/intelmq-malaga-64bit.ova)).
